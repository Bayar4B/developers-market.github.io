# Check and balances : sdg.market

## Selling project parts wihtout owning some
In this case. Delijaj is the seller and Nyomi the buyer.
While testing the trading system on the 3<sup>rd</sup> auction, a seller decided to trad some parts of the project. 
However, she did not own any part of it but the website let her do it anyway. The parts were at 50 token. A buyer 
decided to acquire those parts. The exchange was made and the seller finished with a -50 on the project (like a debt).
This shouldn't happend since the parts must be only managed by the contributors and nobody else.

## Sponsor/Inversor 
As the website is today, the trade is at its basic stage. To improve it, we can put a system of sponsor/investor.
Indeed if we look at the projects, some people will have fantastic ideas but not the means to do it. So to help developping 
the market and the motivation to creat a projet. In the case that a person doesn't want to continue the project, for any reasons,
she could sell it in the platforme to keep it going.
It will creat a real market and viability of the projects.
