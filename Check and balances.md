## Licence
I don’t see the point on creating a new licence, there is already a lot of work being done in that area with licenses like AGPL and SSPL for example. I feel like we should use what we already have since creating such a licence.
“provisional financial attribution based on share ownership, which itself is based on the contribution & trading trails
over the whole history of the project.” This is not in the good place for me, it should be shown at the contributor’s
profile and thus on how we manage the profiles.

## Encouragement to Share (ask thomas stuff)
In what way? By social media? By sharing with other people you “followed” on the platform?
I don’t see how other than having a kind of friend list and we already have a way to advise people for projects.
Since in the whitepaper there isn’t anything written, we could give some ideas.
For instance, we could have a link to some social media such as Facebook or at least the ability to share outside of the platform to get as much interest.

## Merge of two projects
As in the whitepaper it is stated that they don’t know how to make this happened, I will make a proposition.
As we know, we are using git and so we can merge projects together without loosing any previous progress from each projects and thus it can also help for the reuse of modules since we could sort of track them.

## Rewards for reuse of modules outside of the project
This a very good idea but as the state of the website now, we don't have any real bloc or even the possibility to use something.

## Completing/finilise the whitepaper
The whitepaper as it is today feels uncomplete. Some text is just an enumeration of ideas and doesn't look that nice in it. And we have some parts (for instance: Merge of two projects), that are missing (there's no bouton or anything to prove that some options are implemented).

## the state of the project
The website is very basic and we cannot really test some of the functionalities such as the anti-spam/sabotaging implementation and the modules reuse.
