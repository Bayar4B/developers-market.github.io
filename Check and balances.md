## Selling project parts wihtout owning some
In this case. Delijaj is the seller and Nyomi the buyer.
While testing the trading system on the 3<sup>rd</sup> auction, a seller decided to trad some parts of the project. 
However, she did not own any part of it but the website let her do it anyway. The parts were at 50 token. A buyer 
decided to acquire those parts. The exchange was made and the seller finished with a -50 on the project (like a debt).
This shouldn't happend since the parts must be only managed by the contributors and noody else.
