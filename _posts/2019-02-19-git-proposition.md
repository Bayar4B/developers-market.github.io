## Proposition for running sdg market as a git extension using Python

### Introduction
What is your open source project worth ? The SDG market seeks to answer this question through a distributed initiative to give a monetary or token value directly to contributions. As of writing, the SDG market exists as a web application where people can track the market value of projects open on Github. For those unfamiliar, it is essentially a website where such open projects can be published. Currently the value is calculated as a function of the change contributed by each contribution called commits in git jargon. The proposition is to unlock the mechanisms proposed by the sdg market and use them in a decentralized manner independent from Github. The idea is to make the market easily extensible, distributed, compatible with existing workflows and to do all that in respect of the existing open source community at large. The question remains: how ?

### Extensible
In order to make the project more extensible, we thought making it a lightweight command line tool would be best. That is why we are presently working on git-market a command line tool based solely on git and gitPython as the interface enabling us to retrieve and analyze the commits. The motivation is to bring the whole project together frontend and API under one single language. Thus making extensibility much easier also by the fact that python is an easy language to pick up. The case of smart contracts gives us a good example of how this might work. Presently the project uses a levenstein function on the difference between a new commit and the pre-existing text or code in order to give a value to the contribution. This could be viewed as a very basic smart contract that pays a developer in function of how much he contributes. This is a relatively good idea and would work pretty well for documentation or applications that aren't code libraries or APIs themselves. However, it might arise that a user realizes that they actually want to base the attribution of tokens based on the usage of a functionality. With the proposed approach given that the user can write such a function in Python or retrieve the information from an online interface and send this information to our token generation method. For example, one could simply view number of downloads or other simple metrics from a repository and use this to compute a value relative to the contribution. The strongest incentive for developing smart contracts in such a manner is that they are easy to write and can be just as easily understood since python has mature tools for literate programing. We would only need to define a framework for writing these contracts in such a way that they are humanly and legally understandable just like they would be machine understandable.

### Dsitributed
The decentralized nature is one of the simplest problems to solve since once we rely on git and not the API of Github for example the project is already distributed. Since git is already a decentralized version control system and we essentially make sure that the value can be kept or computed on the fly in a similar decentralized manner. Of course talking about smart contracts and decentralization comparisons to cryptocurrencies are bound to arise. We should be weary of throwing around such buzzwords since they have a certain connotation despite the potential benefits of such technologies. Instead I want to suggest we focus on what makes such technologies solid and what can be learned from them. If we look at git it is pretty close to a distributed ledger already in the sense that it is completely decentralized and every node has a copy of the ledger locally making tampering difficult. The challenge for us if we want to take advantage of what makes these ledgers so solid will be making the ledgers tamper proof with some kind of signature based commit system or at least signatures for every time value is transferred. This is doable through GPG signatures, which are a form of numeric signature, where we would require at each value computation that the value be registered as a signed commit that can't simply be rolled back. A second challenge will also be having a strong consensus mechanism since presently git is rather individualized which is fine for code but not acceptable for a store of value. This is still a challenge that will require reflection during implementation before money comes in.

### Workflow compatible
Our aim is to have a tool which anyone could run using a simple command or an interface. The `git market` command would make it possible to instantly evaluate the worth of a repository or branch locally. One of its greatest strenghts is that it would use the exact syntax that so many developers are already familiar with namely `git push`, `git pull` or `git commit`. Thus making it trivial to integrate in ones existing Workflow just adding one stop to check how much ones work might currently be worth. This would even make it possible for a developer to know the value of his work before even pushing to a server based centralized repository. This localizes the process leaving for greater privacy too. And for the less technically inclined it would also be trivial to integrate the process in existing graphical version control tools that already rely heavily on git.

### Respectful of the community
Another important point if we want to work in synergy with the open source community is to respect the existing institutions and standards. It is important that we understand how important the community is to us. Our project being a code project first and foremost we are going to need a strong community if we want to move forward efficiently. One important tenant of open source is licensing. As can be evidenced by the Redis and MongoDB cases two extremely promising open source projects turned businesses that tried twisting their licenses to secure a profit. Resulting in their projects being forked and the community potentially turning away from the original projects. The verdict is not yet said on these projects but more and more they are getting attacked by the tenants of the larger open source community. That is why I think the best license for git-market is most likely an AGPL v3.0. This is the most copy left license in existence since it requires people who develop a product based on this project to also open source their product. Anyone wanting to build a closed proprietary version would have to ask for a special license against a fee of course or use the software as is.

### Conclustion
The two main goals of sdg market as an institution will be on the one hand open source sustainability and on the other democratizing open source development. It is pretty clear that git-market is more helping the first goal but if we are able to solve the first it gives us a solid foundation to attack the second.
