## Brand and Logo
### Introduction
For the website's design, the logo is very important, with it people will keep the image in their head and associate it with certain emotion and will help designing the website itself (such as the colors). The name SDG-market doesn't seem appropriate in my opinion, mostly SDG. In fact, if we want to create a diverse community we should have a more appealing name. Even market at some extend makes the site looking too commercial, even if we have tokens and some kind of value attributed to each project. This document will talk about my reaserch about logos creations and brand naming.
### Finding a good naming
First we are going to look for a name indeed if we think about it the name will give us a good start for a logo. We have many possibilites on how to find a good name, if we look at some brand names we could conclude that the brand names are:
1. Using the founder or inventor’s name (Hewlett-Packard)
2. Describing what you do (Southwest Airlines)
3. Describing an experience or image (Sprint)
4. Taking a word out of context (Apple)
5. Making up a word (Google)

If i think about people everyday life, you'll see they tend to remember unique names. A great name can create buzz, position you as a true leader and innovator, and reinforce your value proposition in a word or two. However it can also neutralize or even negate the work you do to build a position in the market. So it's important to think about it and make a good choice. In the financial point, by choosing a brand we also choose what url we are going to use and thus depending on the money you put in the project certain name price are better than other. After finding some ideas and good urls, we should ask people how do they feel about the name to be sure that it is appealing.
If we follow the step of (1) and some brainstorming, we could come with good propositions.
### The logo
"You want your logo to communicate your brand’s personality. And in order to do that, you first need to understand what your brand’s core personality is. Once you have a clear idea of what makes you unique and what your brand is all about, it will be much easier for you to make design choices that complement and complete that picture." (2). This part is very important since the costumer need to have some leads on our brand by the name and mostly the logo. If we look at some brands we can see that they have a simple image or motif. Being simple is not that bad, in fact we need a easy and effective way to make the audiance remember our brand.
#### Logo design style
(2)Gives us 5 main logo design style that exist:
1. **Classic**: a classic logo will have one color with a certain color background and not too "bright", this style tells people that you are reliable and down to earth.
2. **Retro or vintage**: this type has been populare for a long time and evoke romantic feelings of nostalgia; it uses darktoned colors.
3. **Modern and minimalist**: a clean and minimalist style to communicate how fresh and modern they are by using geometrical images and whitspaces; that's a very modern way to creat a logo and thus showing you are up-to-date.
4. **Fun and quirky**: this kind of logo are mostly targgeting a young audiance with some colorful and cute images.
5. **Handmade and handcrafted**:  this brand is individualistic and stands for handmade quality, it can be mixed easly with the other types montionned before.

Of course all of those types can be fused to give an unique logo.
#### Main type of logo
In addition to the overall style there are **7 main types of logos** we can choose from when we are creating our logo:

**Lettermark logos** can be great to streamline the company logo, especially if the name is very long or hard to remember. Lots of businesses choose to go by their initials, just think of HP, CNN or H&M. These monograms can be great for minimalist logos, but they are not very good at expressing what the business is about.

**Wordmarks** are a very straightforward way of using the company name as a logo. It gives personality and recognition value, they are all about typography—just look at the wordmark logo for ONE.

**Pictorial marks or logo symbols** are what we think of when we hear the word “logo”. They are iconographic images that are easily recognizable and represent the brand with an image. We can choose something simplistic or more complex. Oftentimes these are paired with a wordmark.
Instead of a recognizable symbol, **abstract logo marks** are geometric forms that don’t establish an immediate connection to an existing image but create something entirely new for the brand. An abstract logo mark will condense your business into a symbol that is truly unique to you.

**Mascots** are a fun way of giving your brand a personality. They are often colorful, cartoonish characters that represent your business in a family-friendly and approachable way.

A **combination mark** does exactly what it says on the tin: it combines a symbol with a word mark to create an easily recognizable logo. The brand name is either placed next to the symbol, or is integrated in the graphic element. People will associate both elements with our brand, which allows us to use them both alone or together.

Similar to combination marks, **emblems** are also often a combination of word and pictorial elements. They usually consist of text integrated in a symbol or icon.

#### Color choice
As spoken into my "aspects of a website", colors are very important to vehicule a certain emotion and I already described some colors. To be sure to have matching colors there are 3 different way to associate colors:
1. Using complementary colors (2 opposite colors)
2. Using analogue colors (3 side-by-side colors)
3. Using triadic colors (3 equally spaced around the color-circle, triangle like)

#### Typography
There are 4 types of font that we can use:

**Serif** is a small line or stroke regularly attached to the end of a larger stroke in a letter or symbol, it gives an old-fashioned and elegent look for a brand.i.e Freight Text, Caslon, Garamond and Stanley.

**Sans serif** is the opposite of serif (so no little line), this font is often used into modern and more sleek look. i.e Helvetica, Avant Garde, Arial, and Geneva.

**Script** is a font looking like handwriting and gives a very unique look.i.e Blackletter, Calligraphic, Casual and Celtic. 

**Display** is a typeface that is intended for use at large sizes for headings, rather than for extended passages of body text, this type gives a more funky look. i. Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Decorative and Graffiti.

#### African symbols
Not very used, those symbols have a meaning (see (6)). The advantages are: they don't have any copyright, they are simple and they are not used that much so it could be a good way to be original.
#### Aviding generic logos
To better aprehend the logo creation we can look at existing logos and we can see that there are many logo nearly identic. We would want to avoid having an unoriginal design. The article of (3) really describes well all the used icons and what methode we can use to find a original idea.
