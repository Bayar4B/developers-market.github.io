# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  **A Decentralized Market to Incentivize Sharing Knowledge and Expertise for the UN SDGs**
  This website is developped by Sofia Delijaj and Xoeseko Nyomi as part of their Open Science project.
  The aim is to review the sdg-market to make it production ready. Apply checks and balances
  from the goals set in the whitepaper vs the actual implementation. Add data visualisations
  just like there could be on an actual financial platform and document the whole process.
#baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
#url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
