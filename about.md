# About

## This website was created by Sofia Delijaj and Xoeseko Nyomi to document the sdg market application.

As part of our open science course we were tasked with reviewing the sdg market prototype and documenting it. 
This website is to contain the review process and eventually the data visualisations of what can be done for now.
