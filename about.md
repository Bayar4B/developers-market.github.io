**A Decentralized Market to Incentivize Sharing Knowledge and Expertise for the UN SDGs**
This website is developped by Sofia Delijaj and Xoeseko Nyomi as part of their Open Science project.
The aim is to review the sdg-market to make it production ready. Apply checks and balances
from the goals set in the whitepaper vs the actual implementation. Add data visualisations
just like there could be on an actual financial platform and document the whole process.
