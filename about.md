### What is your project worth ?

Find out the value of a project you are passionate about. Using our implemented algorithms or your own smart contract define a value for contributions and see what the market is ready to pay for it.
Invest in community first. We define a mechanism such that money invested can go directly to developers in fact you don't even need us as middleman.
Contribute to developing a sustainable future for us all. A big proportion of the revenue generated through our project is used mainly to invest in upcoming open source projects with a particular aim towards those that advance the sustainable development goals.
  - Check you ideas against the market and eventually earn money for that
  - Buy tokens directly from projects you find promising
  - Sustain a community of developers while indirectly having a greater impact
