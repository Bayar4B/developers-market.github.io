**A Decentralized Market for Sharing Knowledge and Expertise for the SDGs** 

### Introduction

The 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have set an agenda to make the world more sustainable by 2030. The SDGs follow the Millenium Goals, which were set for the period 2000 until 2015.

Here, we believe that sharing and exchanging valuable open knowledge as well as expertise associated with concrete projects aimed the SDGs, is a way to go that empowers all people willing to contribute.

We also believe that market mechanisms can help bring enough incentives and motivation for people to share knowledge and contribute collectively to the concrete achievement of projects aimed at addressing outstanding issues associated with the SDGs. 

We further believe that if such SDG Market should exist, it should be transparent, decentralized. It should as much as possible avoid intermediaries. However, we keep in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to efficiently sharing knowledge. The  SDG Market Project borrows from past and ongoing & experiences on fast and efficient knowledge sharing.

We aim to establish a common scalable platform to share knowledge for SDGs. 

This draft White Paper has come out discussions held at the iSDG Assembly 2017 in Shenzhen, which gathered high-school students from Beijing with their teachers, university students attending Summer School programs at Tsinghua University, University of Geneva, EPFL, Centre pour la Recherche Interdisciplinaire (CRI) and Harvard University.


### Background
* markets as a driver for trust : people make contracts
* Adam Smith

* crypto currencies
* the devil lies in details : full transparency of the market design in this white paper

### Motivations
* build a community
* fast exchange of knowledge
* scaling 
* excite curiosity

### What people should share :
- their location
- their skills
- what they aim to achieve
- how they value knowledge produced by themselves and others

### Requirements :
* fully open innovation
* transparency 
* respect individual and collective strategies
* maximize opportunity for contributors
* peer review with consensus building

### Governance/Institution :
Foundation

(see Ethereum institutional mechanism)


### Initial Funding & Initial Coin Offering (ICO) : 
The initial funders of the Foundation (min. 50k CHF) share 10% of SDGcoins issued during the ICO, in proportion of their respective contributions.

ICO : one SDGcoin = $5

After ICO : SDGcoins are issued in function of the number of transactions. Every 1000 (+ \epsilon e.g., 10%, to be further determined) transactions, one SDGcoin is issued and sold at market price by the Foundation.

Verification of transactions also bring coin rewards (tbd, but rather a power law decreasing function that flattens, instead of exponential decay which brings problems as for bitcoin).


### License :

* only one license: share - attribute - commercial reuse

### Content and Share Attribution :


####Â Two Possibilities for share attribution :
- one share per contribution [scaled to project value] (preferred)
- one share per 1000 bytes produced [scaled to project value]


#### Incentives to share early and to produce small iterative steps

If use bytes as measure of quantity : 10% penalty following a negative linear function with \alpha = - 0.1 per byte [e.g., 2000 bytes contributed => 2000 x (1-\alpha) = 1800 bytes => 1.8 shares at nominal value (instead of 2)]


### Proposed Mechanisms :
* market :
* arbitrages possibilities: 
- contribute
- buy/sell stocks
- short selling (liability up to wallet and shareholdings, i.e. a short seller may lose everything if the traded project gets very successful)
* slow market : one transaction per minute per user.
* increment : 0.1
* transaction costs : 0.005 ? Where these fees go ? => Association/Foundation


##### Reuse & Fork:
One should be incentivized to reuse parts of existing projects, or even fork projects following the sharing requirement.

##### Reuse :
Reuse is free but incumbent content producers should be rewarded for their past work.
When content is reused from one project to another, the stockholders of the incumbent projects get shares from the reusing project. 

100% of the shares of the latter project and distributed to the individual having performed the reuse. The shares are spread across the shareholders of the incumbent project in proportion of their respective holding in the incumbent project.

##### Fork :
In case of fork, the initial stock of shares in the latter project is set arbitrarily to 200. The incumbent shareholders share immediately 100 shares of the latter project and the individual having fork gets the other 100.

Valuation starts at 1 and initial capital is 200.

Fork of intermediate versions is possible. Distribution of bonus shares to incumbents is made according the contribution and stock values states at the time of the version.

Fork may for instance allow rebooting a project, which has experienced a governance failure.

Expected behavior : a fork is pure replication of content, which brings no additional information. Therefore, if the project does not bring expectation that it will distinguish itself from the parent project, it should lose traction and thus value fairly quickly. Another more annoying but possibility would be that it reaches the same value as the incumbent project (since they both contain the same information). However, this is unlikely because the value of a project entails its capacity to grow and adapt. For that community building is almost required. If the forked project strives with another community, then the fork is a success and the project gets its own value.

##### Merge of two projects:

Not clear how we can have a merge happen besides reusing parts of one project to another, and abandoning the former project by selling stocks until project value gets residual.

(I would not advocate for a negotiation based bargain/deal)

#### Recommendation :
One way to share resources and effort is to recommend/invite contributors to help for a project.

If an invitee to a project makes a contribution, the recommender get half of the shares. If the invitation is carried on further, each recommender get half of the shares of her invitee. For example an invitation is carried on 3 steps and the final invitee has contributed and has received 10 shares. The person who has invited her gets 5 shares, the recommender who invited the person who has found the contributor gets 2.5 shares, and so on recursively. This mechanism offers strong incentives to reach out for targeted help, and to further build the community (It was used for the DARPA Grand Balloon Challenge).

Practical Issues : 
* an invitee new to the system should create an account (equiv. a wallet)
=> one way is to create immediately a wallet per email address. The account can be confirmed later (different emails can be confirmed and consolidated in one account)
* an anti-spam mechanism might be needed, based on peer-review, or by providing a button in the email sent for the invitee to report spam. To deter spam, each invitation may a cost a vey small fee (0.005)


### How does it translate into real money ?
* The objective is primarily to encourage circulation of capital as a way to reveal the true value of projects through a market mechanism.
 
* 
* Optional conditions for use of crypto currency to buy supply : 
- min. 1000 transactions and 100 different traders. To protect shareholder, only up to 20% of the capital can be used for supply in cash. Tickets must be uploaded/contributed and peer-verified by 3 humans (decentralized accounting through a kind of mining)? 

- alternative : use own crypto-cash wallet, and seek reimbursement to the project through peer-verification (accounting mining).


### Blockchain mechanisms

### Overview of Practical Implementation Strategies :

* Platform developed by Bodo
* PoC contribution management with GitHub as a backend
* PoC blockchain market
* PoC contribution management with IPFS


### Next steps :
* review and improvement period for this document (until 31/12/2017)
* presentation at Davos
* European H2020 Grant Application (April) ?
* June 2018 : first working version (with GitHub as backend)
* August 2018 : sdg.market meeting at iSDG Assembly Shenzhen


### Apendices 

#### [future implementation] Delegation of Governance to projects

We start simple enough, but in the future, some rules may be set for each project by the project creator (e.g., share awards for contributions and recommendations. These rules may be changed only with a fork of a project.

#### Alternative Measures of Contribution
