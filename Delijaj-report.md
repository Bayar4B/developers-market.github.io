# Report of Delijaj Sofia

## Introduction
In the idea of our course *Open Science*, we needed to do a project related to the SDGs by having it as an open access project.
We choose to participate in the project of _Thomas Maillart_ because, with the help of discussion Nyomi had with him by mail, we found it really interesting and a great opportunity to learn new concepts (later on Bileg joined us and helped a lot with the design). The project is about making a trading market. We want to put some _"Gamification"_ in it, which means we want to put a reward for each contribution you make and the reward is some tokens. The tokens will be used to buy some parts of some projects or you can get some by selling the parts you own of some projects.
The report will mostly be about my experience through the project (struggling mostly) and the process.

## Problem statement
This project concerns every SDG issues, in other words, the purpose is to get every project related to any SDG. The idea is to find help and a financial to make any project grow.

## Methodology
I mostly worked with Github, Plot.ly and D3.
#### GitHub
GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. I knew what it was but never really worked with it, I was excited to finally be able to understand some things about it. I actually had so many issues with it. Indeed at first the repositories were a mystery, the fork system wasn't explained, the markdown language was new for me (and it was the first time I heard about it).
#### Jekyll
Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. We used it in making the documentation website (in which Nyomi and Bileg worked with mostly)
#### Plot.ly and D3
They are library used to generate dynamic visualisations in Javascript and the opportunity to use it on a website (with HTML).

## Research Results
### The meeting
After several mails we needed to meet Mr.Maillart to see what we could do to help the project without giving us too much to be able to follow the
other courses/projects we had. As the website was pretty new, we had many different tasks which are the ones below:
>1. tester l'interface & API sous toutes ses coutures
=> poster des issues, dialoguer avec les développeurs
=> documenter votre pratique de l'open source avec l'approche critique dans le cadre debugging / onboarding
=> peut-être installer et utiliser Jupyter notebook sur un github repo qui est lui même sur le sdg.market
=> documenter l'experience "recursive" (=> créer un github repo pour étudier le sdg.market, lequel repo est lui-même sur sdg.market)
>=> voir : https://mybinder.org/
=> voir : https://github.com/binder-examples
>2. construire des visualisations de protofolios et/ou d'évolution des cours des projets / series de temps de génération de tokens
=> http://blockbuilder.org/
=> d3.js + gallery
>3. Eventuellement faire quelques statistiques
=> envoyer extended abstract
=> slides
>4. Reflexion générale critique mais constructive.
=> check & balances entre ce que propose le white paper & le prototype son potentiel de dévloppement
>5. Reflexion sur comment on pourrait faire une implémentation blockchain
>6. github page
=> jekyll

He said that we didn't have to do all of them, but we took is as a challenge.
Afterwards, we made our repository in GitHub and created the issues on Nyomi's repository. We assigned some tasks and started to do it.

## Solution Proposal
### Check and Balances
I needed to review the whitepaper to see what has been done and if they managed to do what the whitepaper said. Looking at the state of the website, basic, we could imagine that it is easy. However, as there are so little information displayed (more when you are an admin) and even with testing all the options this task was
### Visualisation
At the beginning, I wanted to make a big chart with multiple coloured lines which you can select to choose what information you want to see displayed. But with my poor knowledge of the Javascript language and the time I had to do it, I decided to make a linear and more simplistic one.
The Javascript language was hard to understand at some points since it's very different from the languages I know, I searched in many websites, such as Stackoverflow to find my answer (even finding what didn't work was difficult enough).
With the poor amount of data we had, I tried, with the help of my team, to make some visualisations to have a better view of what is happening. I wanted to do a dynamic visualisation that allows you to see what is happening over time. The idea in the end is to put it available to the users, like a view of your performances. This view can allow also for the future investors. Indeed, you can look at the productivity or the effectiveness of a contributor.  
## Future Plans
What needs to be done in the future according to the objective given by Maillart are mostly:
1) finish the whitepaper since it is not complete and draft.
2) find a purpose for the tokens, we can have some imaginary tokens and just use them into trading but that's about it.

However, this section is mostly in [Bileg's report.](https://xoeseko.github.io/sdg.market/reports/2018/11/30/Bayar-journey)
