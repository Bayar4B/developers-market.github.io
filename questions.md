# Remaining interrogations

1. Who do the initial 1000 generated tokens belong to ?
2. Are tokens ever given retroactively for previous collaborations ?
3. What happens to tokens given to a contributor if his contribution is taken away ?
4. Is there a measure of impact of contributions (Like with git detective for example ?)
5. This token system functions well as long as the loop is closed since tokens are only worth something inside the system.
Are there plans for real investment to go through the platform ? If that is the case how can aninvestor make sure that his investment does not loose value simply through the contributions made ? (That is also why a measure of impact is necessary)
The value of the token is then the impact and not just the number of contributions.
